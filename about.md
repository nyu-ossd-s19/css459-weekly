I'm a BA/MS student at NYU CIMS graduating in 2020. I have a passion
for Unix development, and I currently work in ML, Predictive Analytics
in sell-side asset management. Outside work and school, I love to cook
in my tiny apartment kitchen, and go sailing when I'm home in Florida.

### More Information

During my undergrad career, I created and continued to maintain
NYU EventsCheckIn up until Fall 2018, when I handed over the project
to other talented developers to pursue work in asset management.

These days, I focus mainly on parallel software design using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA for ML algorithms.
