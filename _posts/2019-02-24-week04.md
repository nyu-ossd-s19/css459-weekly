# Project Evaluation for New Contributers: Scikit-Learn

## Introduction

Scikit-Learn (often called "sklearn") is a library for different machine
learning and data science tools. sklearn is often used with the popular
list/matrix manipulation library: `numpy`. Sklearn offers data
transformation tools like encoding, scaling, normalizing, etc. A full ML
pipeline can be crafted using the transformation, splitting, cross-validation,
models, and evaluation tools offered by Sklearn.

The ML models are expansive (SVMs, Clustering, MLP, Ensembles, etc.) and come
with a host of hyperparameters, meaning you aren't likely to get bottlenecked
by your tools when solving problems in Data Science.

## Motivation

I have a lot to owe to this project. I use it nearly every day for work,
and it's helped our team to do our jobs quickly and easily for our sales
department. Because of the wide range of tools avalable, I felt that this
would be a great project to contribute to.

## Contribution for New Members

Sklearn mentions that adding new algorithms is a somewhat selective process
for contributers, which is fine in my case since they also have a whole
section for new contributers:

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#new-contributors

Currently as of writing, [there are about 37 open](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/good%20first%20issue) "good first issuses."

Most of these issues are either documentation-related, or invovlve data
transformation functions which do not require a heavy need for advanced
mathematics or industry knowledge. Namely, the issues which involve
fixes to algorithms are either linear models, or deal with helper functions
to larger algorithms.

Here are some good examples in the "good first issue" section:

1. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9193
2. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13117
3. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12552

On the issues page, one will also see that most all of the issues contain
about 5-10 comments each. Since the project is so large and so prevalent,
one can also expect a good turnaround time. For intsance, [this issue was closed in less than one week](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/12949).
