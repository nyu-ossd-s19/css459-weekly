# Building a Firefox Extension: My Experience

I had a surprising amount of fun building a Firefox extension. Traditionally, I had never used
pure JavaScript before, so that alone was a nice experience. Throughout the project, we all
took a collaborative and entirely remote experience.


Outside of the fist day in our groups, we did not meet outside of class to work on our projects.
Instead, we communicated entirely through Pull Requests, Issues, Comments, and Facebook Messenger.
This worked well since we all had different schedules and obligations during the day.


For design decisions, we would normally make a Pull Request with a request for comments. This allowed
us to test it out on our machines, and decide via vote whether or not to merge the design changes. However,
we found that we seldom if at all disagreed.


Overall, the experience was great and all my team members were receptive, and talented. We're proud of the
extension we created, and we're working on adding more features, polishing the UI, and potentially publishing
it to the Firefox Extensions Store.
