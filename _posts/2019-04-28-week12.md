# Scikit-Learn: My Contributions Thus Far

We have been working on docmentation fixes thus far, and are now starting to venture
into code-related documentation improvements. Mainly, we focus on these because they
are plentiful, and are more easily apparent as opposed to issues with estimators or
other code-related issues. Moreover, most (if not all) estimators originate from a
paper or other written work which discuss their edge cases, therefore, there is little
bugs are less likely to be encountered here than in documentation.

For the contributions so far, I manage the scikit-learn fork by keeping it in-line with
the upstream master, create the necessary feature branches we work on, and update the
[sklearn-logistics](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/sklearn-logistics) repository with our current work.

For our Pull Requests, we often all have a hand in the commits. I did however issue one
[Pull Request on my own](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13535).

On the Pull Requets we work together on, I've made the following contributions

[Kernel Defintion](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/scikit-learn/commit/fca88dcdc9da487281c5b495197780925d7de5fe)
