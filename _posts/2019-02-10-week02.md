# Building a Browser Extension -- Email Detector

Our team, team 12, has been developing an email detecting borwser extension for Firefox this past week.
We were able to naturally divide up the work into a couple of different parts. Namely: Project architecture,
CSS/HTML, and JS logic. I've been working to manage the overall architecture of the project, and integrate new
featrures that come in as Pull Requests on GitHub. In a way, I work on the integration: Reviewing and testing new
code, as well as making minor fixes to Pull Requests if I see something thats wrong, but easy to fix.


# Status

We expect to have a working product by the due date. Our extension is able to detect emails well, and while we did have
a few minor bugs along the way, we were able to comb those out well in advance. Right now, we are working on the styling
of our extension, as well as thinking of some other features we could add.


# What did I learn about GitHub?

I learned that Pull Requests track the **branch** and *not* the commit hash. As in, one may update a pull request
automatically by updating the branch it tracks. I also learned that you can reference them in Issues by just specifying
the PR number.
