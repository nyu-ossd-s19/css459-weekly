# What is *open source* to me?

I like to think of Open Source as the modern form of a public works project.
Just like a lot of traditional public works, it's conducted by both volunteers
and paid people alike, for the purpose of bettering (or creating) a tool for
the common good. In this way, not only the people who pay or contribute
themselves get to benefit, instead, *everyone* gets to benefit.

I think Richard Stallman sums it up well in his famous line:

> "Think free as in free speech, not free beer."

He makes an important distinction: Just because something is *given* to you
for no charge doesn't mean it's actually *free* (libre).

# Why is that important to me?

Knowing exactly how my software works is important to me, since more often
than not, free (as in "free beer") software comes at the price of the data
you give to interact with it. Personally, I try to minimize that as much as
I can. That's not to say there aren't tradeoffs, some open source software
can be buggy due to lack of development, and some projects can be completely
abandoned.

That isn't to say proprietary software is bad -- In fact I think it even
inspires various UX/UI decisions within open source software like KDE or
GNOME. I like to think of software in general as a commodity, and I like
to be a smart shopper. 

I registered for Open Source because I want to contribute to the software
I use every day. It's a great gift that I get to use all of what I list
below free of charge, and the least I can give back is my time.

# Open Source Projects I Regularly Use

I use Linux on all my computers, and my favorite open source project is
the [Solus Project](https://getsol.us/home/) which I try to contribute
packages and bug fixes to when I can.


On my desktop I have:

* [Debian GNU/Linux with KDE as my Desktop Environment](https://www.gnome.org/)


On my laptop I have:

* Solus (GNU/Linux OS) with GNOME as my Desktop Environment


My essentials are:

* [Mailspring (Mail Client)](https://getmailspring.com/)

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

* [Vim (editor)](https://www.vim.org/)

* [Ranger (CLI file browser)](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

* [Git (of course!)](https://git-scm.com/)


I've stuck with Debian for about a year now, and it hasn't given me trouble
since. I trust it because it's one of the most widely developed and widely
developed linux distributions with versions that have the software curated
for each release -- It's the closest thing I've found for an OS that "just
works."

Solus is a newer Linux OS that's built from the ground-up. It's a smaller
community that I feel I can make a meaningful contribution to. In addition,
it uses a rolling-release model so I don't have to worry about large upgrades
which require special attention, as they often do on Debian.

On both of my machines, I like to use Ranger for managing files because
it offers vim bindings that I'm used to. I'll still use the built-in
file browsers on KDE and GNOME, but Ranger is great for editing system
and configuration files.

Of course, vim is a great editor for C development, which I do a lot of
for school. I like to have one terminal open with my code in vim, and
another that I use for compiling, gdb, and valgrind. I use a series
of plugins that make an experience I prefer over C IDEs.
